<p>  Bone is a complex material with species-specific microstructures. Despite its unique properties, human bone may be confused with other faunal bone, synthetic, or organic
materials, especially to the untrained eye and when fragmented. In forensics and bioarcheology, macroscopic examination could reach its limitation. In such cases,
microscopy may be employed to more reliably differentiate bone from other materials as well as human from non-human bone. </p>

 <p>  To make such assessments, it is crucial to be very familiar with species-specific microstructures and non-bone materials, both
macroscopically and microscopically. This project aims to develop an expansive histological teaching collection openly accessible at the BAFAL Lab (Biological and Forensic
Anthropology Laboratory) that will permit training for students, volunteers, and local law enforcement personnel. Collaboratively, SRAP (Student Research Assistant Program)
students and lab volunteers are preparing microscope slides using a collection of synthetic and organic materials, curated based on macroscopic or expected microscopic structural
similarities to bone. A few examples include coconut endocarp, walnut shell, ostrich eggshell, soft pretzel, and human fingernail. Samples are embedded in epoxy resin, sliced,
adhered to microscope slides, and hand-sanded to an average thickness of 50-100 microns. Using light and polarized light microscopy, we will analyze and document the differences in
material microstructure in comparison to human bone. To make the collection fully accessible for training modules and classes taught at BAFAL, our aim is to also digitally
catalogue the samples. This will enable education for students, volunteers, and local law enforcement both at the lab and from a distance, enhancing experiential learning
opportunities at BAFAL. </p>
